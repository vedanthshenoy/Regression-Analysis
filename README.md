# Regression-Analysis
In this project we will try on different types of regressions such as Linear regression and  Support vector regression (SVR) . One task is to predict GPA from student weight and another task is to find the relationship between humidity and temperature.

## Regression Problem

Until now, we have been seeing how machine learning models can be used for classfication tasks. Classification problems always have a finite number of classes in the output. This is not always the case as there are problems where we may be in need to find out an output value which is continuous for example; Price of a house,temperature or weight, height etc. These types of problems which deal with the continuous value in the output is known as regression problem.

There are several typesof regression algorithms but in this project we will focus mainly on Linear regression and support vector regresion.

## Linear Regression

Suppose you want to predict a student's GPA from his/her weight..
You generally plot it on a graph with the y-axis as GPA and x-axis with weight values. Obviously you are creating this graph using a table which maps weight to GPA from a survey dataset. An example table is shown below and also the graph scatter plot is shown.
